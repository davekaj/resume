      <p>
        I am a founder and blockchain engineer working in crypto since 2017.
        I am currently looking to join a DeFi project with an impactful mission and a great team.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work experience is shown below. I have been obsessed with DeFi and rebuilding the financial infrastructure our world runs on since 2020, and will continue to be for many years to come.

      <h2>Ekonomia & Photon Finance - 2022 - 2023</h2>
      <div>
        As the founder, CEO, and CTO, I grew our team to 8 people. However, after one year, we decided to shut it down before launching a product due to our slow pace and lack of innovation in decentralized stablecoins. I was responsible for architecting the entire system, hiring the team, and mentoring many engineers.

      <h2>The Graph / Edge and Node - 2018 - 2021</h2>
      <div>
        As the seventh hire and the first smart contract engineer at The Graph, we built and launched The Graph Network in late 2020 with a small team. Along with another engineer, I wrote the protocol in Solidity and undertook significant backend work in TypeScript. I also engaged extensively in conferences and hackathons, teaching people how to build Subgraphs. I left in 2021 to pursue my own startup venture.

      <h2>Polymath - 2017-2018</h2>
      <div>
        I joined as the second hire on the team as a smart contract engineer and contributed to the launch of the network in early 2018 before leaving to work on The Graph. There, I focused on the protocol in Solidity and developed extensive backend code in TypeScript and JavaScript.
